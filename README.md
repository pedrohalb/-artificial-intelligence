>This project involves using supervised AI models such as KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree to solve problems such as breast cancer detection and credit
>approval. Furthermore, it includes a project for a classifier whose proposal consists of exclusively using an electronic spreadsheet to develop a model capable of
>classifying the data provided.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (google colab)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To test the application, follow these steps:

1. **Download the zip file**;

2. **Extract the file**;

3. **Open it in google colab**;

4. **See the project**.

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

The project is divided into two parts. In the first, KNN, Random Forest and Decision Tree are used to address the problem of breast cancer detection. Initially, the data from each database is divided into training and testing sets. Then the models are trained and tested, and a comparison is made using graphs to determine which model is most effective for the problem.

In the second part, the Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest models are used for the credit approval problem. In the same way as in the first part, the data is divided into training and testing sets, the models are trained and tested, and comparisons are made to identify which model is most effective for the problem.
